✅ So the big map looks like this:

Foundations → Math Tools → Core Concepts → Canonical Problems → Angular Momentum/Spin → Many-Particle Systems → Approximations → Entanglement & Information → Advanced Topics.

Do you want me to expand each into a structured "study plan" with examples and equations (like a curriculum), or just keep this as a compact reference list?
