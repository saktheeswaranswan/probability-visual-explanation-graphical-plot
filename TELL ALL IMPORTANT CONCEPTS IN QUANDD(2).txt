Dirac Equation in Curved Spacetime

Generalized with tetrads + spin connection

Used in quantum field theory in curved space (Hawking radiation, cosmology)

4. Important Relativistic Structures

Clifford algebra: Algebra of gamma matrices

SL(2,ℂ) ↔ Lorentz group double cover

Newman–Penrose formalism: Spinor approach to GR

Twistor theory (Penrose): Spinor-based reformulation of spacetime

5. Applications

Special Relativity

Lorentz transformations of tensors and spinors

✅ So, the map looks like this:

Tensors (geometry, curvature) → Spinors (Lorentz reps, Clifford algebra) → Dirac formalism → Tetrads & spin connections (curved spacetime) → Advanced frameworks (Newman–Penrose, twistors, supersymmetry).

Do you want me to make this into a progressive "study ladder" (with key equations at each step) like a roadmap to actually learn tensor–spinor calculus for relativity, or do you prefer this as a reference summary only?
